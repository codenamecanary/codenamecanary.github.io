            <p>Get involved with a cleanup day in your local area. Registrations are open for <a href="http://cleanupaustraliaday.org.au">Clean Up Australia Day 2016</a>, but you'll be able to find something before then too.</p>

            <h4>Take 3 For the Sea</h4>
            <p>Next time you're at the beach, make the effort to take three pieces of plastic home to recycle. Snaptrash is very proud to support <a href="http://take3.org.au">Take 3</a>. Got a bit more time on your hands? Try a <a href="http://beachclean.net">2 Minute Beach Clean</a> and quadruple your haul!</p>

            <h4>Reuse Reduce Recycle</h4>
            <p>If Jack Johnson sang it, it must be a good thing. Reduce your consumption of single use plastic items, like shopping bags and water bottles (ideally to zero!). Reuse and upcycle clothes and furnature - one man's trash is another man's treasure! And recycle <em>everything</em> you can! Most local governments in Australia have comprehensive recycling programs that should reduce the number of overflowing garbage bins we see.</p>

            <p>What's that? We already mentioned this elsewhere on the website? Oh! Sorry about that...</p>
