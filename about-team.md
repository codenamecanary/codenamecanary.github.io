####Ben Plunkett - Founder

####Sam Mead
Oceanographer, front end web developer, experienced startup guy! Passionate about the environment and being the change that I want to see in the world.

####Marla Dillabough
Corporate communications and marketing / world traveler - for me, itâ€™s all about diversity! Taking care of our environment means ensuring there are all sorts of different foods to eat (drooling over Spanish raf tomatoes), cool animals to see (just saw a mole cricket), new sports to try (latest = sand boarding), different people to interact with (6 people, 5 nationalities at Snaptrash!), and on and on. Diversity means that every day can be an adventure, no matter how far you go. And Snaptrash is helping the masses to preserve our diversity.

####Fernanda Lorena
Brazilian translator and world traveler! Experienced with marketing and branding. Passionate about sustainable fashion. Creative and critical thinker!

####Kim Smith
Australian budding web and graphic designer. Recent UWA Graduate!
