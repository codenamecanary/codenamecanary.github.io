###Codename Canary is now Snaptrash (but trash is still trash)!

Love it, you say? Nice, that’s what we were hoping, because you asked for it! We received lots of feedback about our super cute name being a bit hard to remember and a bit long. So after some “ask the audience” rounds and intense brainstorming sessions, one of our members came up with Snaptrash in a moment of genius. Thanks Lou! We hope that you'll find it catchy, easy to remember and easy to associate with what we do.

<p class="lead">So from this afternoon, our website is <strong><a href="http://snaptrash.org">www.snaptrash.org</a></strong>, our Facebook page is <a href="https://facebook.com/snaptrash.org/">facebook.com/snaptrash.org/</a>, and in the next couple of days we will change our Instagram and Twitter profiles to be @Snaptrash_AU. Going forward, our hashtag will be #snaptrash.</p>

Hard to believe that Codename Canary is barely 4 weeks old! Here's a quick recap of our journey so far:  

**November 13th** - Codename Canary was officially born at Perth Startup Weekend

**November 14th** - We met a good chunk of our first members around Perth, doing some very guerrilla-style surveying. It's not the easiest thing to do, but they were so cool about it!

**November 15th** - Our team took the insights we learned from you, and your overwhelming cry to "do this!", to the Perth Startup Weekend finals, winning second prize, woot woot!

**November 25th** - Our 50 up moment - we had 50 uploads to Instagram, from all over the world, using our hashtag #canarytrash in just over a week

**November 27th** - Our 150 moment - we were 150 members strong after 2 weeks

**December 4th** - Our 450 moment - we received 450 bucks in donations in 3 weeks

**December 11th** - Our feel good moment - we named the awesome organisations [Take3](http://www.take3.org/) and [Bottle for Botol](http://www.bottleforbotol.org/) to be the first recipient of our donation dollars

Whew! Thanks for all of your support to reach those incredible milestones!

##Please keep snapping that trash and posting to it to Instagram with #snaptrash.
