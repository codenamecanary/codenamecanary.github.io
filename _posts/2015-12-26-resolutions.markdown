###Snaptrash New Year Resolutions for 2016!

1. Get (the environment) fit for 2016
1. Consume less (plastic)
1. Watch less tv (about marine debris)
1. Quit drinking (out of plastic bottles!)
1. Enjoy life to the fullest!

New Year's resolutions... what to do, what to do?! Do you go big and lofty? Do you stay realistic and achievable? Do you make them at all because they don't last anyway?

Well, we've taken a look at what the experts say is key to achieving your goals and wanted to do a quick litmus test with ours. Here goes...

**Identify obstacles** - Yep. Our biggest obstacles are getting enough people to know about us AND upload photos of trash to #snaptrash. We've got a long way to go, but in only 6 weeks we've seen the number of people doing it grow. Good start. Next.

**Find a role model** - Did we ever. Tim Silverwood and [Take 3](http://www.take3.org.au).

**Be accountable** - We're keeping you updated with our progress on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_snaptrash/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/snaptrash.org/) and [this cool map](http://snaptrash.org/statsandmaps/). We also send more detailed updates from time to time to our members (sign up [here](/)!)
Set clear goals - We want to reach 500 photo uploads to our Instagram account by February to take to the authorities!

**Get an action plan** - Got one. It revolves around getting everyday people to take photos of trash! And, getting businesses to help us expand our reach and spread the word. Contact us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/snaptrash.org/) if you could help us open a floodgate.

**Baby steps** - Love it. We're our own worst enemy here. We want it all, today!

**There will be a choice** - What?! Sounds very Starwarsy. May the force be with us when we have to choose...
Well, not too shabby. It also helps that we are super committed and fueled by the number of people becoming a Snaptrash member and by the photos you upload everyday, of trash, from locations around the world. Keep it up!

For every **three** photos that each person uploads, we will send you a video shoutout of one of us on the Snaptrash team getting the environment fit for 2016!

Merry Christmas and thank you for your support!

##Please keep snapping that trash and posting to it to Instagram with #snaptrash.
