Little over a week since we launched Codename Canary at Startup Weekend, we're stoked to tell you all that we've had over 50 uploads to Instagram with the hashtag #canarytrash! We don't like to toot our own horns, but 'beep beep'.

It's great to knock over an early milestone so now it's time to get our heads back down and push on to the next goal... Which is 500 post by Christmas! Difficult? Yes! Achievable? Absolutely! 

Check out all the [#canarytrash uploads on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/canarytrash/), but more importantly, get your photos of litter, trash, and pollution up on Instagram asap!

Cheers,
Sam
