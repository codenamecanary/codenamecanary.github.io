The Codename Canary team was totally stoked to end up in second place at the seventh Startup Weekend Perth!

Having spent 48 hours locked up on Level 9 at Spacecubed, Ben got up to pitch again, a little more prepared but probably also a little bit more nervous than he had been on Friday night when he pitched the idea for Codename Canary for the first time.

Queue technical failure... We were the 7th team to pitch but the first after dinner during which time the batteries for the slideshow clicker died! Not idea but Ben handled it like a champ and delivered one of the better pitches of the evening. Sam got a bit carried away during Q&A but it didn't seem to harm our chances too much as we ended up in second place overall!

From the official Startup News recap of the event:

> Once more the horde of eager entrepreneurs gathered in the town hall at Spacecubed, and prepared to spend a weekend building dreams. [...] My verdict on the weekend: great job by most of the teams. [...] [The judges] had a hard time sorting out the winners, hence the honourable mention.

We've started off at a bit of a sprint but it doesn't look like we'll be slowing down any time soon!
