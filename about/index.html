            <hr class="spacer spacer-left">
            <p>We're here to give the crowd a voice; to tell those with the power to do something on the scale required that it's time we all took action. Our mission statment is simple: </p>
            <blockquote>
              To increase the awareness of the <strong>causes</strong> and <strong>scale</strong> of pollution around the globe, to the extent that the current trend of increasing pollution is reversed. We are aiming for the amount of litter, trash, garbage, and general waste entering the environment every day to be a net reduction.
            </blockquote>
            <p>So how does uploading a photo to Instagram help reduce pollution?!</p>
            <p>Well, to initiate the large scale projects required to <strong>a)</strong> clean up existing pollution, and <strong>b)</strong> prevent future pollution, we (the people) need stregth in numbers. We've decided Instagram is the place where we can get those numbers. By posting your photos of trash and pollution in the environment with the #canarytrash, you join tens of thousands of other people who are taking a stand against pollution. </p>
            <p>By collating these images we're making a protest, and when we reach a large number of geotagged photos for a given location, we'll have the evidence we need to take to the controlling authorities in the affected areas. </p>
            <p>Sometimes, those in power need a sign from the people that a tipping point has been reached. Just like a canary in a mineshaft, pollution has reached the point at which it's about to take a turn for the worse. Here's hoping we can pull it back before it's too late!</p>
            <p>How many times have you crossed paths with a bunch of trash? Does it annoy you? Do you feel helpless in front of a pile of rubbish in the street, or at the beach, or in the park? Because yes! It annoys us. We want to make a difference by being part of a community that is worried about pollution issues.</p>
            <p>By uploading your picture with the #canarytrash you connect with other communities and change makers around the world, spotting the problem and highlighting the need for action in that region. <strong>#canarytrash!</strong></p>

            <br />

            <h2 class="no-margin-top">Transparency and FAQ</h2>
            <p class="lead">That's 'Fantastically Awesome Questions'.</p>
            <hr class="spacer spacer-left">
            <p>As a not-for-profit NGO we expect to be held to stringent levels of transparency, honesty, and openness. To that end, you can trace every dollar we receive via donations, as well as every dollar we spend.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>What do you spend your money on?</strong><br />
              Every dollar raised to date is held in enscrow. When we reach our first milestone of $5,000 we will be releasing funds to two projects we have identified to support (one here in Australia, and one overseas).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>So, you haven't spent any money yet?</strong><br />
              That's right - all operating costs are covered personally by our directors. We will continue to operate in this way for the forseable future.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What are your operational costs?</strong><br />
              At the moment our only operating costs are to keep our website and platform live and online. We use open source software as much as possible to keep development, hosting, and operational costs as low as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How does uploading a photo to Instagram help curb pollution?</strong><br />
              By highlighting to the powers that be just how many people care about pollution. We're adressing what we've identified as the number one problem for lovers of the environment: that feeling of helpless when they encounter trash, waste, litter and other garbage in the natural world. By uploading an image to a platform that is collecting and analysing masses of open, crowd-sourced data, our platform offers a way for individuals to contribute to a much bigger cause. <br /><br />
              There's also a second benefit to the platform. Because our data is both qualitative and quantitative, we can see (for example, via <a href="/stats/">this map</a>!) where the worst affected areas are globally, and make sure we concentrate our efforts on making a bit impact in those areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Wait a minute, doesn't that map only show you where your users are, not necassarily where the pollution is?</strong><br />
              That's right! Glad you pointed that out. It's an issue that we're working hard to address by making sure awareness of our platform is as wide-reaching as possible, and the good news is, you can help us do that in a number of ways! By sharing our <a href="/donate/">Donations Page</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/codename_canary">Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://instagram.com/codenamecanary">Instagram</a> accounts with as many people as possible, we can help spread the word further and further every day.
