            <hr class="spacer spacer-left">
            <p>We're here to give the crowd a voice; to tell those with the power to do something on the scale required that it's time.</p>
            <p>So how does uploading a photo to Instagram help reduce pollution?!</p>
            <p>Well, to initiate the large scale projects required to <strong>a)</strong> clean up existing pollution, and <strong>b)</strong> prevent future pollution, we (the people) need stregth in numbers. We've decided Instagram is the place where we can get those numbers. By posting your photos of trash and pollution in the environment with the #canarytrash, you join tens of thousands of other people who are taking a stand against pollution. </p>
            <p>By collating these images we're making a protest, and when we reach a large number of geotagged photos for a given location, we'll have the evidence we need to take to the controlling authorities in the affected areas. </p>
            <p>Sometimes, those in power need a sign from the people that a tipping point has reached. Just like a canary in a mineshaft, pollution has reached the point at which it's about to take a turn for the worse. Here's hoping we can pull it back before it's too late!</p>
            <p>How many times have you crossed paths with a bunch of trash? Does it annoy you? Do you feel helpless in front of a pile of rubbish in the street, or at the beach, or in the park? Because yes! It annoys us. We want to make a difference by being part of a community that is worried about pollution issues.</p>
            <p>By uploading your picture with the #canarytrash you connect with other communities and change makers around the world, spotting the problem and highlighting the need for action in that region. <strong>#canarytrash!</strong></p>
            <br />
