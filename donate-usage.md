Currently we use every dollar we receive in donations to fund projects operated by our partner organisations.

For Summer 2015-16 we're partnered with and supporting [Take 3 - A Clean Beach Initiative](http://take3.org.au), an Australian not-for-profit formed in 2009. Take 3 encourages each visitor to the beach, waterway or _anywhere_ to simply take 3 pieces of rubbish with them when they leave, and dispose of them thoughtfully. They also encourage everyone to reduce unnecessary plastic consumption - and make our lives a little less plastic!

We're inspired by the work of all the guys over in NSW at Take 3. Here's a bit more of an insight into one of Australia's most recognised environmental NGOs:

Remember it's not only donations that support Snaptrash and our partners! You can also get involved and [support us](/donate/support/) in a number of different ways, as well as [taking direct action](/takeaction/) yourself to support the cause.
