<p class="lead">How many times have you encountered litter, trash, and plastic waste on a glorious sandy beach?</p>

Or in a park, in town, or in the country? The reality is that unfortunately, the answer for most of us is **every day**. The problem is, often times we're **helpless to do anything about it**. We're faced with pollution on such a large scale that it makes it seem tough for one person to do anything about it.

Codename Canary was formed to try to address this problem: an individuals helplessness in the face of pollution in the environment.

>I've long been a fan of initiatives like [Take 3 For The Sea](http://www.take3.org.au) and [2 Minute Beach Clean](http://beachclean.net) but it frustrated me that more people didn't know about them. We've built Codename Canary to help take the influence of individuals doing their bit to a higher level of effectiveness. Now we can combine all of our individual efforts and use that strength in numbers to organise large-scale cleanups, educate the worst offenders, and lobby policymakers around the world.

Codename Canary was formed at [Startup Weekend Perth](http://www.startupnews.com.au/2015/11/17/startup-weekend-perth-7/) and is now operating full time. We're passionate about making a difference to the state of the environment, and to that end we're committed to reversing the tide of pollution entering natural ecosystems.

So how does uploading a photo to Instagram help reduce pollution?!

Well, to initiate the large scale projects required to **a)** clean up existing pollution, and **b)** prevent future pollution, we (the people) need strength in numbers. We've decided Instagram is the place where we can get those numbers. By posting your photos of trash and pollution in the environment with the #canarytrash, you join tens of thousands of other people who are taking a stand against pollution.

By collating these images we are acquiring:

+ A list of places that we can collaborate with local organisations to clean up pollution,
+ Data we can use to trace the origin of trash in the worst polluted areas,
+ Evidence we can use to influence policymakers to make environmentally friendly decisions, and;
+ Material we can use to educate communities on how to better deal with their waste and plan for the future.

<p class="lead" markdown="1">You can help us achieve these aims in a [number of different ways](/donate/support/), but primarily, by uploading your pictures of trash, litter and pollution to Instagram with the hashtag **#canarytrash!**</p>
