**What do you spend your money on?**

Every dollar raised to date is held in enscrow. When we reach our first milestone of $5,000 we will be releasing funds to two projects we have identified to support (one here in Australia, and one overseas).

**So, you haven't spent any money yet?**

That's right - all operating costs are currently covered personally by our team. We will continue to operate in this way for the foreseeable future.

**What are your operational costs?**

At the moment our only operating costs are to keep our website and platform live and online. We use open source software as much as possible to keep development, hosting, and operational costs as low as possible.

**How does uploading a photo to Instagram help curb pollution?**

By highlighting to the powers that be just how many people care about pollution. We're addressing what we've identified as the number one problem for lovers of the environment: that feeling of helpless when they encounter trash, waste, litter and other garbage in the natural world. By uploading an image to a platform that is collecting and analysing masses of open, crowd-sourced data, our platform offers a way for individuals to contribute to a much bigger cause.

There's also a second benefit to the platform. Because our data is both qualitative and quantitative, we can see where the worst affected areas are globally, and make sure we concentrate our efforts on making a bit impact in those areas.
