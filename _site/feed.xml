    <description>We don&#39;t like pollution. Pollution is a global issue. It&#39;s dangerous and annoying. We&#39;re here to help you put an end to it.

        <title>Snaptrash New Year Resolutions!</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;snaptrash-new-year-resolutions-for-2016&quot;&gt;Snaptrash New Year Resolutions for 2016!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get (the environment) fit for 2016&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consume less (plastic)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watch less tv (about marine debris)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quit drinking (out of plastic bottles!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enjoy life to the fullest!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Year’s resolutions… what to do, what to do?! Do you go big and lofty? Do you stay realistic and achievable? Do you make them at all because they don’t last anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we’ve taken a look at what the experts say is key to achieving your goals and wanted to do a quick litmus test with ours. Here goes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify obstacles&lt;/strong&gt; - Yep. Our biggest obstacles are getting enough people to know about us AND upload photos of trash to #snaptrash. We’ve got a long way to go, but in only 6 weeks we’ve seen the number of people doing it grow. Good start. Next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a role model&lt;/strong&gt; - Did we ever. Tim Silverwood and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.take3.org.au&quot;&gt;Take 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be accountable&lt;/strong&gt; - We’re keeping you updated with our progress on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/_snaptrash/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/snaptrash.org/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://snaptrash.org/statsandmaps/&quot;&gt;this cool map&lt;/a&gt;. We also send more detailed updates from time to time to our members (sign up &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!)
Set clear goals - We want to reach 500 photo uploads to our Instagram account by February to take to the authorities!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get an action plan&lt;/strong&gt; - Got one. It revolves around getting everyday people to take photos of trash! And, getting businesses to help us expand our reach and spread the word. Contact us on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/snaptrash.org/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; if you could help us open a floodgate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baby steps&lt;/strong&gt; - Love it. We’re our own worst enemy here. We want it all, today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be a choice&lt;/strong&gt; - What?! Sounds very Starwarsy. May the force be with us when we have to choose…
Well, not too shabby. It also helps that we are super committed and fueled by the number of people becoming a Snaptrash member and by the photos you upload everyday, of trash, from locations around the world. Keep it up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every &lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; photos that each person uploads, we will send you a video shoutout of one of us on the Snaptrash team getting the environment fit for 2016!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas and thank you for your support!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;please-keep-snapping-that-trash-and-posting-to-it-to-instagram-with-snaptrash&quot;&gt;Please keep snapping that trash and posting to it to Instagram with #snaptrash.&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>Codename Canary is now Snaptrash!</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;codename-canary-is-now-snaptrash-but-trash-is-still-trash&quot;&gt;Codename Canary is now Snaptrash (but trash is still trash)!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love it, you say? Nice, that’s what we were hoping, because you asked for it! We received lots of feedback about our super cute name being a bit hard to remember and a bit long. So after some “ask the audience” rounds and intense brainstorming sessions, one of our members came up with Snaptrash in a moment of genius. Thanks Lou! We hope that you’ll find it catchy, easy to remember and easy to associate with what we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;So from this afternoon, our website is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://snaptrash.org&quot;&gt;www.snaptrash.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, our Facebook page is &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/snaptrash.org/&quot;&gt;facebook.com/snaptrash.org/&lt;/a&gt;, and in the next couple of days we will change our Instagram and Twitter profiles to be @Snaptrash_AU. Going forward, our hashtag will be #snaptrash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard to believe that Codename Canary is barely 4 weeks old! Here’s a quick recap of our journey so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 13th&lt;/strong&gt; - Codename Canary was officially born at Perth Startup Weekend&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 14th&lt;/strong&gt; - We met a good chunk of our first members around Perth, doing some very guerrilla-style surveying. It’s not the easiest thing to do, but they were so cool about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 15th&lt;/strong&gt; - Our team took the insights we learned from you, and your overwhelming cry to “do this!”, to the Perth Startup Weekend finals, winning second prize, woot woot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 25th&lt;/strong&gt; - Our 50 up moment - we had 50 uploads to Instagram, from all over the world, using our hashtag #canarytrash in just over a week&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 27th&lt;/strong&gt; - Our 150 moment - we were 150 members strong after 2 weeks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 4th&lt;/strong&gt; - Our 450 moment - we received 450 bucks in donations in 3 weeks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 11th&lt;/strong&gt; - Our feel good moment - we named the awesome organisations &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.take3.org/&quot;&gt;Take3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bottleforbotol.org/&quot;&gt;Bottle for Botol&lt;/a&gt; to be the first recipient of our donation dollars&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 14th&lt;/strong&gt; - Rebrand moment - Codename Canary is now Snaptrash!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whew! Thanks for all of your support to reach those incredible milestones!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The fifty&#39;s up!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Little over a week since we launched Codename Canary at Startup Weekend, we’re stoked to tell you all that we’ve had over 50 uploads to Instagram with the hashtag #canarytrash! We don’t like to toot our own horns, but ‘beep beep’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s great to knock over an early milestone so now it’s time to get our heads back down and push on to the next goal… Which is 500 post by Christmas! Difficult? Yes! Achievable? Absolutely!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/canarytrash/&quot;&gt;#canarytrash uploads on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, but more importantly, get your photos of litter, trash, and pollution up on Instagram asap!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,
Sam&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Silver medal at Startup Weekend Perth 7!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Codename Canary team was totally stoked to end up in second place at the seventh Startup Weekend Perth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having spent 48 hours locked up on Level 9 at Spacecubed, Ben got up to pitch again, a little more prepared but probably also a little bit more nervous than he had been on Friday night when he pitched the idea for Codename Canary for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queue technical failure… We were the 7th team to pitch but the first after dinner during which time the batteries for the slideshow clicker died! Not idea but Ben handled it like a champ and delivered one of the better pitches of the evening. Sam got a bit carried away during Q&amp;amp;A but it didn’t seem to harm our chances too much as we ended up in second place overall!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the official Startup News recap of the event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once more the horde of eager entrepreneurs gathered in the town hall at Spacecubed, and prepared to spend a weekend building dreams. […] My verdict on the weekend: great job by most of the teams. […] [The judges] had a hard time sorting out the winners, hence the honourable mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve started off at a bit of a sprint but it doesn’t look like we’ll be slowing down any time soon!&lt;/p&gt;
