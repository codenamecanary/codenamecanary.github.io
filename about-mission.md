We exist to channel the outrage people share about pollution into a photo-taking _frenzy_ that gives us the evidence to tell those in power: “Do something!”. It's time to clean up the existing trash, litter and garbage spoiling the environment and address its cause.

<h4>Our objectives are:</h4>

1. Influence the decisions of policymakers to do more about the current state of the environment,
2. Influence the decisions of policymakers to do more to prevent further decline of the natural environment,
3. Raise awareness as to the number of people who feel passionately about enjoying a clean, pollution free planet, and;
4. Educate those who both knowingly and unknowingly contribute to pollution events.

<br />
We know these objectives ambitious but we believe that a clean environment is paramount to the population enjoying a more prosperous future, both socially and economically.

<h4>To achieve these objectives our tactics are:</h4>

1. Gather qualitative and quantitative evidence of unwanted pollution via photos uploaded to Instagram,
2. Analyse the evidence to exert data driven influence on policymakers in control of the worst affected and the highest priority areas for both cleanup and prevention,
3. Create volunteering opportunities designed to raise awareness of the opinions of the environmentally conscious public to extend our influence, and;
4. Partner with existing organisations with similar aims and goals to increase the effectiveness of their work.
